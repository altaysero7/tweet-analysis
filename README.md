# tweet-analysis

I used Twitter API to get Elon Musk’s tweets. First, I analyzed the Twitter accounts
that mentioned Elon Musk starting from the date 2022/10/03. After that, I got his
latest tweets and printed the names of those who liked Elon Musk’s last tweet.
Finally, I did a bit of data visualization using the data I obtained from the API and
some cool stuff with all the data I gained from Elon Musk’s tweets that he posted
until today. I discovered some interesting facts, such as the most commonly used
words by Elon Musk. I also plotted the most mentioned people and the organization
names in his tweets.
